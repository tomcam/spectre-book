# The LEAST you need to know about Spectre.css

### Preview on GitHub Pages:
[https://tomcam.github.io/spectre-book/](https://tomcam.github.io/spectre-book/)

This is a book in progress on how to use the remarkable [Spectre.css Framework](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/). Spectre.css has a perfectly balanced blend of features. Spectre is

* Small (about 10-20KB gzipped)
* Fast
* Compatible with a wide range of older browsers, dating back at least to Android 4.4 ([officially supports last 4 versions of all major browsers](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre#browser-support) but goes back further than that
* Feature-rich, with a [huge set of components](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre#browser-support)
* [Well-supported](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre/issues)
* Stable and nearly bug-free

## Free Spectre.css example templates

While this book is in progress, check out the [Examples](examples/) section for usable code from the book.

## What makes this book different

This book emphasizes the use of complete HTML files with extensive comments, instead of providing fragments without context. Whenever possible, each concept discussed contains at least one downloadable HTML file you can run as is.

* eBooks seem to prefer about a 60-character line length:
