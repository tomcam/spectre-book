## How to

### Screenshots
* Name screenshots starting with the word screenshot, hyphen, item name (like 2col-blog), hypen, the dimensions
(e.g. 1024x512), a hypen, then spectre-css and finally the extension. 
So, for example screenshot-2col-blog-1024x512-spectre-css.png
* Upload to /screenshots
* When linking, follow this pattern. Note the directory, such as examples, may need changing.
